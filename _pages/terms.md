## Terms of Service

Last Updated: 12 November, 2019

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully as they contain important information about your legal rights, remedies and obligations. By accessing or using CoCo, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms.

Thank you for using CoCo!

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement ("Agreement") between you and CoCo (as defined below) governing your access to and use of the CoCo website, including any subdomains thereof, and any other websites through which CoCo makes its services available (collectively, "Site"), our mobile, tablet and other smart device applications, and application program interfaces (collectively, "Application") and all associated services (collectively, "CoCo Services").

The Site, Application and CoCo Services together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “CoCo Platform”. Our Property Agreements, Privacy Policy and other policies applicable to your use of the CoCo Platform are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

When these Terms mention “CoCo,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the CoCo company you are contracting with. Your contracting entity will generally be determined based on your country of residence or establishment.
Our collection and use of personal information in connection with your access to and use of the CoCo Platform is described in our Privacy Policy.

Any and all payment processing services through or in connection with your use of the CoCo Platform ("Payment Services") are provided to you by one or more CoCo Payments entities (individually and collectively, as appropriate, "CoCo Payments") as set out in the Payments Terms of Service ("Payments Terms").

#### 1. Scope of CoCo Services

1.1 The CoCo Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“Members”) to reserve and purchase accommodations, services and experiences offered by CoCo and selected third parties. All transactions and payments are managed through the CoCo Platform. Third party service providers (“Partners” ) are able to communicate directly with Members as part of fulfilling their services.

1.2 As the provider of the CoCo Platform, CoCo does not own or manage accommodations which are listed on the platform. CoCo is not a real estate broker or agent, but purely a platform to facilitate transactions and services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. CoCo is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members.

1.3 While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, CoCo has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. CoCo does not endorse any Member, Listing or Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by CoCo about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use other Third Party Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person.

1.4 The CoCo Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“Third-Party Services”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. CoCo is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by CoCo of such Third-Party Services.

1.5 Due to the nature of the Internet, CoCo cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the CoCo Platform. CoCo may restrict the availability of the CoCo Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the CoCo Platform. CoCo may improve, enhance and modify the CoCo Platform and introduce new CoCo Services from time to time.

2.2 You will comply with any applicable export control laws in your local jurisdiction. You also represent and warrant that (i) neither you nor your Service(s) are located or take place in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

2.3 CoCo may make access to and use of the CoCo Platform, or certain areas or features of the CoCo Platform, subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or a Member’s booking and cancellation history.

2.4 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).

2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the CoCo Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions, before you can access the relevant areas or features of the CoCo Platform. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the CoCo Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise in the latter terms and conditions.

#### 3. Modification of these Terms

CoCo reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the CoCo Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you do not terminate your Agreement before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the CoCo Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.

Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Property as a result of such Overstay. If you Overstay at an Accommodation, you authorize CoCo (via CoCo Payments) to charge you to collect Overstay Fees.

1.2 CoCo Payments may temporarily and under consideration of the Members’ legitimate interests (e.g., by providing prior notice), restrict the availability of the Payment Services, or certain services or features thereof, to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the Payment Services. CoCo Payments may improve, enhance and modify the Payment Services and introduce new Payment Services from time to time. CoCo Payments will provide notice to Members of any changes to the Payment Services, unless such changes do not materially increase the Members’ contractual obligations or decrease the Members’ rights under these Payments Terms.

1.3 The Payment Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“Third-Party Services”). Such Third-Party Services are subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices and Members should review them independently.

1.5 Your access to or use of certain Payment Services may be subject to, or require you to accept, additional terms and conditions.

If we make changes to these Payments Terms, we will post the revised Payments Terms on the CoCo Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Payments Terms.

If you disagree with the revised Payments Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right of refusal and your right to terminate this Agreement in the notification email.

2.3 We may make inquiries we consider necessary to help verify or check your identity or prevent fraud. Towards this end, you authorize CoCo Payments to screen you against third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers. In some jurisdictions, we have a legal obligation to collect identity information to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. This may include (i) asking you to provide a form of government identification (e.g., driver’s license or passport), your date of birth, your address, and other information; (ii) requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, Payment Methods or Payout Methods; or (iii) attempting to screen your information against third-party databases. CoCo Payments reserves the right to close, suspend, or limit access to the Payment Services in the event we are unable to obtain or verify any of this information.

#### 3. Account Registration

3.1 In order to use the Payment Services, you must have an CoCo Account in good standing. If you or CoCo closes your CoCo Account for any reason, you will no longer be able to use the Payment Services.

3.2 You may authorize a third party to use your CoCo Account in accordance with the CoCo Terms. You acknowledge and agree that anyone you authorize to use your CoCo Account may use the Payment Services on your behalf and that you will be responsible for any payments made by such person. If you reside in the EEA and contract with CoCo Payments Luxembourg, this Section 5.2 does not apply.

#### 4. Payment Methods and Payout Methods

4.1 When you add a Payment Method or Payout Method to your CoCo Account, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address, and financial instrument information either to CoCo Payments or its third-party payment processor(s). You must provide accurate, current, and complete information when adding a Payment Method or Payout Method, and it is your obligation to keep your Payment Method and Payout Method up-to-date at all times. The information required for Payout Methods will depend on the particular Payout Method and may include:

Your residential address, name on the account, account type, routing number, account number, email address, payout currency, identification number and account information associated with a particular payment processor.

4.2 When you add or use a new Payment Method, CoCo Payments may verify the Payment Method by authorizing a nominal amount or by authenticating your account via a third-party payment service provider. For further verification, we may also (i) authorize your Payment Method for one or two additional nominal amounts, and ask you to confirm these amounts, or (ii) require you to upload a billing statement. We may, and retain the right to, initiate refunds of these amounts from your Payout Method. When you add a Payment Method during checkout, we will automatically save that Payment Method to your CoCo Account so it can be used for a future transaction.

4.3 Please note that Payment Methods and Payout Methods may involve the use of third-party payment service providers. These service providers may charge you additional fees when processing payments and Payouts in connection with the Payment Services (including deducting charges from the Payout amount), and CoCo Payments is not responsible for any such fees and disclaims all liability in this regard. Your Payment Method or Payout Method may also be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by the applicable third-party payment service provider; please review these terms and conditions before using your Payment Method or Payout Method.

4.4 You authorize CoCo Payments to store your Payment Method information and charge your Payment Method as outlined in these Payments Terms. If your Payment Method’s account information changes (e.g., account number, routing number, expiration date) as a result of re-issuance or otherwise, we may acquire that information from our financial services partner or your bank and update your Payment Method on file in your CoCo Account.

4.5 You are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of your Payment Method and Payout Method information. CoCo Payments is not responsible for any loss suffered by you as a result of incorrect Payment Method or Payout Method information provided by you.

4.6. If your Contracting Entity's location is different than the country of your Payment Method or your selected currency is different than your Payment Method's billing currency, your payment may be processed outside your country of residence. For example, if you make a booking using a U.S.-issued card, but select Euro as your currency, your payment may be processed outside the U.S. Banks and credit card companies may impose international transaction fees and foreign exchange fees on such international transactions. In addition, if you select to pay with a currency that is different than your Payment Method's billing currency, your bank or credit card company may convert the payment amount to your billing currency associated with you Payment Method, based on an exchange rate and fee amount determined solely by your bank. As a result, the amount listed on your card statement may be a different amount than that shown on checkout. Please contact your bank or credit card company if you have any questions about these fees or the applicable exchange rate.

#### 5. Financial Terms for Guests

5.1 You authorize CoCo Payments to charge your Payment Method the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your CoCo Account. CoCo Payments will collect the Total Fees in the manner agreed between you and CoCo Payments via the CoCo Platform. CoCo Payments will generally collect the Total Fees after the Property accepts your booking request. However, if you pay with a push Payment Method (such as Sofort), CoCo Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time of your booking request or after the Property accepts your booking request. CoCo Payments may offer alternative options for the timing and manner of payment. For example, in some cases, Guests may be required to pay or have the option to pay for Property Services in multiple installments. Any additional fees for using offered payment options will be displayed via the CoCo Platform and included in the Total Fees, and you agree to pay such fees by selecting the payment option. Additional terms and conditions may apply for the use of an alternative payment option. If CoCo Payments is unable to collect the Total Fees as scheduled, CoCo Payments will collect the Total Fees at a later point. Once the payment transaction for your requested booking is successfully completed, you will receive a confirmation email.

5.2 When you request to book a Listing, CoCo Payments may also (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your Payment Method for the Total Fees, (ii) charge or authorize your Payment Method a nominal amount, to verify your Payment Method, or (iii) authenticate your account via a third-party payment service provider to verify your Payment Method.

5.3 If a requested booking is cancelled either because it is not accepted by the Property or you cancel the booking request before it is accepted by the Property, any amounts collected by CoCo Payments will be refunded to you, and any pre-authorization of your Payment Method will be released (if applicable). The timing to receive the refund or for the pre-authorization to be released will vary based on the Payment Method and any applicable payment system (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, etc.) rules.

5.4 You authorize CoCo Payments to perform the Payment Method verifications described in Sections 6 and 8, and to charge your Payment Method for any bookings made in connection with your CoCo Account. You hereby authorize CoCo Payments to collect any amounts due,by charging the Payment Method provided at checkout, either directly by CoCo Payments or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor, and/or by one or more of the payment methods available on the CoCo Platform (such as gift cards).

Overstay Fees payable under the CoCo Terms. In addition, CoCo Payments may recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting the Overstay Fees by charging any Payment Method(s) you have on file in your CoCo Account (unless you have previously removed the authorization to charge such Payment Method(s)).
Fees improperly paid to you as a Property. If, as a Property, your Guest cancels a confirmed booking or CoCo decides that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking, and CoCo issues a refund to the Guest in accordance with the CoCo Terms, Guest Refund Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, or other applicable cancellation policy, you agree that in the event you have already been paid, CoCo Payments will be entitled to recover the amount of any such refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Payouts due to you.
Fees, costs and/or expenses associated with a Damage Claim, including any Security Deposit, as set out in the CoCo Terms.

More information on Recurring Payments (including the amount and the frequency of payments) will be made available via the CoCo Platform if applicable to a booking.

6.4.2 If Recurring Payments apply to a confirmed booking, then the Guest authorizes CoCo Payments to collect the Total Fees, and the CoCo agrees that CoCo Payments will initiate Payouts, in the increments and at the frequency agreed to and identified via the CoCo Platform.

6.4.3 Guests may stop payment of a Recurring Payment by notifying CoCo Payments orally or in writing at least three (3) business days before the scheduled date of the payment.
