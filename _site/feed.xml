When you're living a lifestyle that has you constantly on the go and you don't settle in to any one social circle, boy oh boy does this get even harder.&amp;nbsp;

Most adult friend groups are formed at work and in the absence of an office, coworking spaces can be the next best thing. People go to coworking spaces to, well, work though, so it's not always the most conducive to having the conversations that lay the groundwork for becoming best pals. Sooooo what's a lonely nomad starved for social interaction to do?

Welcome to Chiang Mai, land of meetups\! If you want to hang out with your fellow location-independent peoples in an environment designed for socializing and bonding over shared interests, here's a list of the best meetups in Chiang Mai for connecting with digital nomads.

## Remote Collective Popup Coworking

Hosted once a week during &quot;the season&quot; (roughly September through February), this popup event takes over a lesser known cafe or coworking space in the city. Free to attend, it's a great place to meet new people or to reconnect with those you've met but haven't yet had a chance really speak with.

Remote Collective is a media brand led by the inimitable Brittnee Bond, and if you've ever been to one of her events, you know she's gonna make you talk and open up. At the popup coworking days, she invites attendees to share a little about themselves and what they're working on, so it's a great place to get a sense of what others are doing and find potential collaborators.

After the initial intros though, everybody is free to hang out or focus on work as they choose, or connect further and enjoy chitchatting. People come to work, to have meetings or just for the social aspect. It's super low key so you can decide what feels best for you.

This year the popup coworking days have been held every Thursday in the lobby of the drop-dead gorgeous Home Chiang Mai Hotel. [Check the Remote Collective Facebook Page for the latest details and to RSVP](https://web.facebook.com/theremotecollective/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## Chiang Mai Entrepreneurs Meetup

A good networking event has to have either alcohol or activities, and this monthly meetup has both. Billed as &quot;the networking event for people who don't like networking,&quot; this meetup happens every second Friday of the month at Burisiri Hotel (which happens to be a super chilled coworking space by day).&amp;nbsp;

The Chiang Mai Entrepreneurship Association (CMEA) which hosts these has a stated aim to build a bridge between Thai, expat, and nomad entrepreneur communities, so you get a more diverse mix of people than at your standard digital nomad event.&amp;nbsp;

If you're interested to learn more about the city, connect with local business owners and diversify your network, this is the meetup for you. Participants can join the event for a 100baht cover and in addition to the usual mixing and mingling, they also facilitate &quot;Speed Networking.&quot; While it may sound intimidating, the format is actually great for getting past the usual awkwardness of networking and making quality connections in a short amount of time.

CMEA is also the group currently lobbying the government for a digital nomad visa and they have ties to startup agencies and institutions, so if you've thought about building a business base in Thailand or tapping into local resources, they're the people to talk to.

[RSVP at the Chiang Mai Entrepreneurship Association's Facebook Event](https://web.facebook.com/events/351594402154543/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## CNX Social

Also held at the Burisiri Hotel, the CNX Socials happen every other Friday during &quot;the season.&quot; Super laid back, these are organized by the vivacious Serena and tend to draw an eclectic crowd. A 50baht cover keeps away the truly miserly, but don't break the bank.

With no set agenda, the meetup has a totally chilled out vibe and hey, if you want to jump in the pool, no one minds so long as you're dressed for it\! Many a new best-friend group has formed at this gathering and while the attendees aren't necessarily all digital nomads, there's a strong feeling of being with like-minded people.

[Stay tuned to their Facebook Page for event updates](https://www.facebook.com/pg/CNXSocial/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}. CNX Social also puts on other great nomad-focused social events and professional workshops.

## Digital Wombats Meetup

If you don't know what a digital wombat is, no stress, you're still welcome to show up at this friendly meetup hosted by the delightful Beki Adams. The meetup up goes where she goes so you may have seen it in Budapest or elsewhere in Europe, but for the next few months you can join her crew in Chiang Mai.

The Wombats meetup wanders around town too, usually opting for a rooftop bar. It's free to attend and you can grab a drink, hangout and make some new friends. On quiet evenings about a dozen people will show up, but as we roll into high season the meetup is becoming more popular too.

&quot;Digital Wombats is a relaxed meet up that is focused around meeting new friends who are staying in Chiang Mai for a longer time. There's a lot of meet ups for backpackers but this meet up is all about meeting new nomads and connecting over your current projects\!&quot;

The meetup is usually held bi-monthly on a Monday and you should&amp;nbsp;[join the Digital Wombats Facebook group to hear about upcoming events](https://www.facebook.com/groups/673717272821398/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## Passion Project Digital Nomad Meetup

New on the meetup scene this year, Passion Project Cafe has started hosting digital nomad meetups in conjunction with [Nomad Radar](https://nomadradar.app/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, an app for finding - you guessed it\! - digital nomads a la Happn.

Perhaps a bit redundant in a town like Chiang Mai where you can hardly go anywhere in high season without being surrounded by nomads, but one can imagine it's useful in big cities that are more densely populated or up and coming nomad towns&amp;nbsp;

Regardless, the Passion Project Cafe is a gorgeous space and a favorite of nomads since it opened last year. If you haven't checked it out before, their coffee is great, their food's delicious and you can spend the afternoon comfortably working there before packing up your laptop and grabbing a cocktail to socialize once the meetup kicks off.

Held so far on Wednesday evenings, things are in full swing by 8pm so best come early. [RSVP to the Facebook Event for times and updates](https://web.facebook.com/events/2518586038256274/?_rdc=1&amp;amp;_rdr){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## Mundo Lingo

Language lovers unite\! If you're looking for conversation partners to practice a new language with or you'd like to internationalize your circle of friends, the Mundo Lingo events are right up your alley.

Delighting the child within all of us, attendees are invited to play with stickers. A flag sticker for your home country goes up top and additional flags for any languages you speak can also be chosen. Grab drinks, mix and mingle in whatever language you like best\! These meetups have great attendance and the format shakes it up nicely from the usual night out.

Mundo Lingo is available around the world so if you're a fan, you can look them up in other cities to meet locals and nomads alike.

Held on Tuesdays at November Bar by the river, you can&amp;nbsp;[look them up and RSVP on their website](https://mundolingo.org/city.html?cityId=7){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## Digital Nomad Coffee Club

Join nomads, entrepreneurs, and marketing professionals on Fridays to meet and learn with the Digital Nomad Coffee Club. The group's been running since 2015 and each meetup has a different theme and speakers who will share their wisdom and insights.

&quot;Come, Learn, Mix and Mingle with the Nomads of Chiang Mai in a social environment where you can actually hear each other =) and learn stuff to help you in your business. Afterwards, many continue on together and share their experiences over a meal.&quot;

The organizers are loose about the format and others are invited to run their own events, lunches, and meetups under the umbrella.

[Join their group for updates](https://web.facebook.com/groups/nomadcoffee/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, but you can hardly miss the events as they'll be posted far and wide on le Facebook in the days leading up.

## Weekly Bitcoin Mixer

Founded by crypto enthusiasts Boban Milošević and Stefan King, these meetups have become a staple of the digital nomad social scene in Chiang Mai.

Whether you're deep into investing or a total newbie to cryptocurrency and the wonders of blockchain, this is a great place to learn and make friends. All that's required is curiosity and a willingness to learn, but deep wells of nerdiness will get you far with this crowd.

[RSVP to the event on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoinsinchiangmai/events/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;} or just show up every Thursday. Stefan typically runs a &quot;crypto and blockchain for dummies&quot; session prior to the mixer so anyone who'd like to be better informed before the jump into the fray can get some solid background.

## Ladies Lunch at Free Bird Cafe

If you identify as a lady, a woman, or a girl, you're cordially invited to the weekly lunch held at Free Bird Cafe. Held from 12-2pm every Wednesday, this is a casual gathering of women that draws a mix of locals, nomads and other travelers.

Their menu is all plant-based featuring Shan Burmese inspired noms and wholesome treats like smoothie-bowls and kombucha.

Free Bird is a social enterprise cafe supporting education for Burmese migrants and refugees, so in addition to eating food that's good for you, you know your money is going to people who will do good with it. Onsite they also have a donation center, second-hand shop, and zero-waste refill shop. It's all the good things you can do for your body, soul and planet all in the same space\!&amp;nbsp;

Owner Lisa Byrd has really stepped it up of late with the activities, so be sure to [follow the Free Bird Cafe Facebook page](https://web.facebook.com/FreeBirdCafe/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;} to find out about movie nights, fundraisers, open mics, and more.

## Corner Bistro &amp; Small House Kafe

Honorable mention on this list goes to a pair of bars that every nomad should know and love. While they don't host events for digital nomads per se, their proximity to nomad hangouts means that on any given night, you're likely to be rubbing shoulders with your crowd.

Meeting people at bars is about as old school as you can get, but there's a reason classics become classics. If you're not into the structure of meetups or just can't make the timings, then try these bars on for size.

They're located directly opposite each other a block behind Huay Kaew Road so if you're not feeling the vibe of one, just run across the street to try the other.

Corner Bistro has an insanely active events calendar\! Hosting open mic nights, stand up comedy, pub quizzes, movie nights and more. Their staple event is Friday Fries &amp; Hip Hop, a great place to sip and sway to your favorite bootie-bouncing tunes.

Owners Kevin and Sa put a lot of love into this space and even in the off season you'll find stalwart patrons dutifully perched on their regular barstools so anytime of year, it's a good place to meet people. [Follow their Facebook page to stay tuned for the latest events and specials](https://web.facebook.com/cornerbistrocnx/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

Small House Kafe basically takes the opposite approach to marketing. They're a simple bar for simple folks, and owners Chris and Dao are happy to keep it that way. The latest event they put on was the delightful *It's Tuesday...*

&quot;Facebook likes to remind us that we don’t really exist unless we host more events, so we’re hosting one. This coming Tuesday we are celebrating our existence. We will be open on Tuesday. We were open last Tuesday and we will continue to be open on future Tuesdays. Come celebrate all of our existences this Tuesday or any other Tuesday. All nights only, (except Sunday and Monday, we cease to exist on those days.) Drink all you can afford and ignore the people who annoy you. We’ll be open late\! (Or midnight whatever comes first.)&quot;

If your humor has a sarcastic streak, this is the bar for you. [Follow their Facebook page for basically no notifications ever (except maybe for Dao's birthday](https://web.facebook.com/SmallHouseKafe/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}).

### [Follow CoCo Chiang Mai for Nomad-friendly Events](https://web.facebook.com/joincococnx/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}

If you've done the rounds on the above events and you're looking for something new or the idea of putting on a name-tag to meet people makes you cringe, might we suggest you [give our very own Facebook page a follow at CoCo Chiang Mai](https://web.facebook.com/joincococnx/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}? We regularly host events, activities, and excursions designed just for nomads\!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Chiang Mai is a great place to meet people whether you prefer to do so in a structured environment that helps you get over those awkward hellos or you're a social butterfly seeking a new circle or admirers. So put down that phone, clean your nose, fix your hair and say hello to a new friend today\!&amp;nbsp;

Nomad List kills it with all their live-feeds and data and many a wise blogger has spent time in Chiang Mai and shared their insights with the world, but still these groups are damn useful.

Getting answers from a human instead of Google ~~is lazy~~ feels nice, but living in a new city, you're also likely to encounter situations which are common enough that other humans have likely been through them, but wayyyyy too specific for even those most niched-down content creator to bother with.

That said, it's dangerous stuff wandering in the online world with strangers, and not all of them are kind or reliable. On the internets, there be trolls a plenty, and even when people are nice… They may be well-intentioned but are straight up ~~idiots~~ terrible at communicating.

If you're trying to research Chiang Mai for the next stop on your nomad tour or&amp;nbsp; you're newly arrived and trying to settle in, here's are some Facebook groups you might consider joining and some suggestions, caveats and warnings about what they're like.

\_\_\_

But before we start, we want to give you the one super useful tip that will make your life a whole lot easier and keep you on group admins' good side. Search\!

When looking at a group on your web-browser, you'll see the search bar on the left options panel:

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2019-10-28-at-10-59-31-am.png){: width=&quot;2050&quot; height=&quot;1226&quot;}

In mobile, this lives at the top of the page when you're within the group:

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2019-10-28-at-11-07-52-am.png){: width=&quot;1392&quot; height=&quot;1162&quot;}

Repetitive questions can bring down the quality of the group (and open you up to newbie-bashing by trolls). Since most situations are probably not unique to you, help others help you by helping yourself first and check that someone's not already taken the time to provide an answer to your question.

The best place to start your foray into life as a Chiang Mai digital nomad is this aptly named group. Running since 2014, this massive Facebook community is 30K members strong an counting.

While the networking opportunities are tremendous and you can tap into a wealth of highly relevant knowledge an experience, do know that noob-trolling is likely. Before posting in this group, check Google, or you'll bring great shame upon your house. The admins and moderators seem to have really stepped it up of late, but beware the comments can get gnarly from time to time.

Most posts in this group fall under the categories of &quot;how to digital nomad,&quot; &quot;what condo should I live in,&quot; and visa questions and gripes. Posts need to be approved by an admin before they go up which usually happens within a day, but it's not the best for urgent questions. If you make use of the search function though, there's tons of great answers which have been provided over the years.

## [Chiang Mai Nomad Girls](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ChiangMaiNomadGirls/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2019-10-31-at-4-52-03-pm.png){: width=&quot;2042&quot; height=&quot;772&quot;}

If you identify as a woman, you're in luck. Chiang Mai Nomad Girls is one of the friendliest, most supportive, and informative Facebook groups for nomads and expats. &quot;Girl&quot; aside, this is an age-inclusive community and you'll find as many long-termers in there as true nomads.

A great place to find out about events and activities in Chiang Mai, buy/sell/swap clothing and household tems, and get advice on figuring out how to live in Chiang Mai, the women in this group have each other's backs.

Do refrain from asking for recommendations for where to get your hair done or what the best &quot;ethical elephant experience&quot; is because the moderators have seen that shit go down way too often and comments will get turned off.

There's a high expectation for the quality of engagement, but as long as you're polite and not blatantly advertising just about anything goes.

## [Chiang Mai Nomad Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/330015100986334/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2019-10-31-at-4-52-30-pm.png){: width=&quot;2040&quot; height=&quot;664&quot;}

An attempt to recreate the magic of the girl's group for a gender-inclusive audience, Chiang Mai Nomad Community was created in response to a low-point in the history of the first Chiang Mai Digital Nomads group.

While it definitely doesn't have as many members, the people in this group are engaged and helpful. Conversations here tend towards events and lifestyle in Chiang Mai more than nuts and bolts of making a living online and travelling the world, but as it grows topics are becoming more diverse.

## [Thai Visa Advice](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1395920320731833/?ref=group_header){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2019-10-31-at-4-52-49-pm.png){: width=&quot;2046&quot; height=&quot;772&quot;}

If you have visa questions, this is the place to go. The admin of this Facebook group, Tod Daniels, is ON IT and irrelevant posts will definitely get deleted.

Maybe that seems initimidating, but it actually means lots of high quality answers to search through and great responses to new questions.

The group is geared more towards expats and the long-term community, but also accommodates digital nomads. Because Thailand's visa and immigration situation is so irregular and prone to changes, this visa advice group is absolute gold.

An excellent repository for events in Chiang Mai, this group definitely beats whatever new features Facebook is trying to flog with it's new Local app.

If you're trying to find what's happening in the city, you'll see restaurant and bar promotions, parties, arts and cultural activities, workshops and professional events, conferences, and more in this group.

The admins are strict about how often people post in the group so do be mindful of the rules if you're using it to promote an event, but the quality of posts and interactions in this group are generally good.

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2019-10-31-at-4-53-25-pm.png){: width=&quot;2046&quot; height=&quot;806&quot;}

If you're a foodie, you've absolutely gotta join this group\! A few long-time expats and locals contribute the vast majority of restaurant reviews in this group, but all are welcomed to share their food experiences and reviews in this Facebook group.

The admins do ask that you include the name of the restaurant and an address when sharing a review, and they will also vocally remind you to be careful about negative reviews because Thailand's anti-defamation laws are no joke, but other than that it's a chill and enthusiastic vibe.

Check this group for new restaurant alerts and dining promotions. They also regularly do a &quot;Chiang Mai Food Fight&quot; and awards for categories like best burger, best khao soi, or best cheap Thai eats.

![](/uploads/screen-shot-2019-10-31-at-4-53-59-pm.png){: width=&quot;2044&quot; height=&quot;774&quot;}

Created by the hosts of the monthly [Chiang Mai Entrepreneurs Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/351594402154543/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, this private Facebook group is a place for networking and sharing jobs and opportunities.

Pionering a &quot;public networking&quot; mentality, they encourage people to post in the group when they're in search of support or professional services instead of just messaging people one-to-one. Afterall, loads of entrepreneurs and aspiring business-owners probably want access to some of that same information.

Doing business in Thailand depends on who you know even more so than in many other countries, so this is definitely a useful group if you're thinking to start a local business or put down roots in Chiang Mai.

Oh boy… This group can be super duper useful because the network taps into a lot of long-term residents, but that same network has a lot of middle-aged dudes with nothing better to do than sit at home on their computers all day and blast their opinions online.

Literally nobody asked you for your opinion on Thai women and how Thailand is changing for the worse or otherwise Dave\! The OP asked where she could buy running shoes in Western sizes….

Proceed with caution and be prepared for vitriol and misogyny. Under no circumstances admit publically that you're a digital nomad or face vast quantities of judgement from old dudes who can't cope with a world that's making them less and less relevant.

Buy things\! Sell things\! The sharing economy in Chiang Mai is very well facilitated by this ginormous group. The admins have A LOT on their hands so they can get a bit finicky about the rules and taking down old posts so give them a hand why don't you and put in the effort to be a quality seller.

Whether you're on the hunt for furniture, a motorbike, a house or some electronic geegaws, this group is better than eBay. Do mentally prepare yourself for people asking questions that were already answered in your descriptions and attempting to low-ball you.

Thailand's second city and its undisputed cultural capital. Take a gander at the endless temples and scenic mountains and it's no wonder why Chiang Mai draws millions of visitors a year. Once you taste your first kao soi or discover your first hidden-gem cafe, you'll also start to understand why many never leave.

But why is it that digital nomads are so obsessed with Chiang Mai? While its ranking wobbles up and down seasonally, you'll almost always&amp;nbsp;[find Chiang Mai topping the charts on the likes of Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/best-cities-for-digital-nomads){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

There are scores of blog posts and videos on the topic, so to make this worth publishing, we're gonna help add some context. We've got your classic checklist for essential reading, but we'll also give you the why of it.

Any nincompoop can show up and get a good sense of the why for themselves (or hire someone on Upwork to research and regurgitate their own version, of course), but with our history here, we hope to add a little more nuance. How did these things come about, how have they changed over time, and how unique are these factors really?

So without further ado, here are the thirteen reasons why Chiang Mai is such a beloved digital nomad hotspot.

## 1\. Well-Developed Travel Infrastructure

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/3oxRmwOLK6OLi9IFI4?video=0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Let's start with a big round of applause for dear old CNX. For those not in the know, that's the airport code for Chiang Mai International Airport, the gateway to the city.

It's a given that good airport connections are important to the location independent entrepreneur with a penchant for country-hopping, so the ability to come and go easily is one of the top reasons for Chiang Mai's popularity.

It might seem like a small thing, but heading out to the airport from other Thai cities takes time. Bangkok? Good luck getting in or out during rush hour which lasts basically half the day. Phuket? Pattaya? That's a looooong drive my friend. Anywhere in the islands? You've got ferries to contend with if not extra connecting flights.

In Chiang Mai, most of us live within thirty minutes of the airport. Thirty minutes is also about the time you typically need to allot to going through security (if you're fond of living on the edge). It's pretty easy breezy all around.

[CNX takes you directly to most anywhere you want to go in Thailand and tons more destinations abroad](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-chiang-mai-cnx){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;} courtesy of Air Asia and other budget-friendly airlines.&amp;nbsp; Coming and going from North America or Europe? You might be able to get away with just a single layover thanks to long-hauls from the likes of Emirates, Korean Air (codeshared with Delta), EVA Air, and Cathay Pacific.

While you may be maddened by the noise of airplanes constantly flying overhead when you're living here, it's the price we pay to be able to so effortlessly hop and bop around Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Essential for a city that caters to the nomad set.

## 2\. The Weather is Great

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/JHCcEc9vLvHZS&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Thailand is a sunny, tropical destination. Do we really need to explain further? Temperatures range from a sizzling 36&amp;deg;C in the summer ([which we very sensibly cope with by breaking out into a city-wide water fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_&amp;#40;Thailand&amp;#41;){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}) to an adorably nippy 15&amp;deg;C during &quot;winter&quot; nights and mornings.

Seasonal Affective Disorder is real folks, and if you ditched the rat race to pursue health and happiness, the last thing you want to do is live somewhere that predisposes you to depression. Chiang Mai is, fortunately, the opposite of the gloomy conditions you get used to in Europe or North America. [We get sunshine at least 150 hours a month, but usually it's almost twice that](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,Chiang-Mai,Thailand){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}. That's basically free therapy right there.&amp;nbsp;

Great weather is also great for being in the outdoors, whether that's lounging by the pool on hot days, searching for hidden waterfalls, or just relaxing cocktail in hand at an al fresco rooftop bar.

That said, we Thais believe in airconditioning, so you're always able to escape mother nature at will and choose your own temperatures. Your coworking and accommodations will almost certainly come with aircon.

High season for tourism corresponds closely with the time of year when digital nomads are in Chiang Mai, from [November through February. It's the best time to be here](https://www.theblondtravels.com/when-is-the-best-time-to-visit-chiang-mai/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}. Sunny warm days and refreshingly cool evenings and nights when you might even - gasp\! - want a sweater.

## 3\. We're Surrounded By Natural Beauty

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/tLxsi1ABsIfza&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;As mentioned, Chiang Mai's great weather lends itself to fun in the outdoors, and you absolutely must get out into the scenic countryside and hills of the province. Just as it's easy to board a flight and go anywhere from Chiang Mai, it's also incredibly easy to escape the city for a change of scenery. Hop on a motorbike or book a redtruck and drive in any direction - within twenty minutes or less you'll find yourself zipping past rice-fields or winding along mountain roads.

We have a very robust cafe culture in Thailand, and if there's a viewpoint or something pretty, we'll stick a cafe next to it. Quite probably there'll be free WiFi as well, so all these escapes into the countryside need not come at the expense of your work or clients.

If you truly do want to escape though, there are jungle homestays, remote retreats, and temple-based Vippassanas in abundance so it's very easy to unplug in order to commune with nature and the spirits and what-have-you.

Few travelers come all the way to Thailand without taking advantage of its natural delights, but it has been our experience that an astonishing number of digital nomads miss out on this aspect entirely, spending all their time within the few blocks that surround their apartment and coworking space.

Those that fall in love with Chiang Mai often cite nature, the mountains and our beautiful surroundings as one of the city's most enchanting qualities, so we highly recommend taking the time to truly experience it.

## 4\. People Are Friendly

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/26FeXqXo2lBeXnsiY?video=0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Truly connecting with Thailand also means connecting with its people. Known as the Land of Smiles, this moniker is one visitors can easily confirm. Hospitality and manners are deeply important to Thais, and the country is well developed for tourism, so everywhere you go you can find friendly people ready to help you.

Beyond the gracious hospitality, Thais have a very live and let live attitude that makes it easy for people from very different backgrounds to feel like they have a place here. While the behavior of some Westerners may elicit a raised eyebrow, it will often be accompanied by an accommodating Thai smile. &quot;Mae pen rai,&quot; as we say. No worries, you do you.

For the oddballs, geeks, and outsiders who never feel like they fit in at home, Chiang Mai is a haven and the city boasts a very eclectic and intellectual expat community. For anybody who's bursting with creative expression or just likes to be a little outrageous - welcome\! You will find your weirdos here.&amp;nbsp;

Thai people are very friendly, but it's also the long-standing expat community that makes Chiang Mai such a great place for digital nomads. The city has long been home to English Teachers, NGO workers, and a thriving international business community. The first wave of the digital nomad movement were the tech workers who relocated to Chiang Mai, already an established destination for software outsourcing.

Get to know the locals, we're a weird, wonderful bunch and you might be surprised at the tech, innovation, and entrepreneurship that's happening outside the nomad scene.

## 5\. Making Friends is Easy

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:64%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/DuRTsbyVCRCwg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;It's one thing for the lady who sells you your daily coconut or avocado smoothie to be smiley, it's another thing entirely to be able to make friends. It's hard crossing cultural boundaries to make friends, but in Chiang Mai it's easy to find your tribe.

Have we mentioned we've got lots of oddballs and creatives here? Whatever your hobby or pet project, there's almost certainly a meetup or event that supports it. And if there isn't? It's so easy to start your own thing. Having the space to explore these affinities equates to opportunities to find your tribe. Improv? Crypto? Mountain-biking? Board games? Queer poetry? You name it, we've got it.

When you're traveling a lot, it's easy to feel lonely and disconnected, so being able to make friends and feel truly seen and heard is important. It also helps when you feel like those friendships aren't just passing. As a digital nomad hotspot, chances are really good that the friend you made in Berlin or Bali last year will come around at some point so you can reconnect. Your friendships may not be continuous, but they continue when Chiang Mai is one of your bases.

While they're not that common yet (though trust us, we'll make them happen) coliving spaces also provide as easy way to slot into a community. More than just move-in ready rentals, they're a place where casual conversations in the shared kitchen can deepen into real friendships.

And if it's the local Thai community you want to connect with? Honestly, Tinder is probably the easiest way to start making connections, though the quality of these encounters, romantic or not, can be hit and miss. If you work on your spoken Thai and make an effort to escape the nomad bubbles though, Thais are a welcoming lot. People can be shy and nervous because they don't speak English well, but attitudes are quite welcoming of foreigners.

## 6\. You're Surrounded By Talent

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/lQfiQeN2LM1SFaYdgJ&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Beyond friendships and hobbies, Chiang Mai is also a great place to meet people who can help you to level up and move your projects forward. This is the real magic of Chiang Mai for digital nomads.

If you want a crash course on how to get into the SEO and affiliate marketing game or how to set up your Amazon FBA empire, there is an incredible wealth of knowledge you can absorb. Yes, there's lots of people who will try to sell you on their course or coaching, but there are as many or more people who will share their time and talent with you for free.

People like being good at stuff, and we've got a lot of people here who are at the top of their game. It's like they almost can't help themselves when they see somebody struggling with something that's so easy for them. Why not help? They're already crushing it and they're not threatened that some noob might run off with their secrets.

Our experience has been that established entrepreneurs and professionals are super generous with their time and knowledge here. It feeds a virtuous circle where mentors and masterminds groups are easy to find because people pay it forward. The city has web development and marketing experts galore, experienced entrepreneurs and consultants for all areas of business.

If you want a free crash course, just hang around the watercooler at a coworking space or show up at a few meetups. And if you want to pay for the real deal? We've got top-notch experts you can hire if you've got the coin, as well as freelancers just starting out willing to cut a good deal or who'll work for trade.

The networking opportunities here are insane. The hard part isn't so much meeting people, it's balancing the time to actually get work done with all the opportunities to learn and grow. Fortunately, there are also plenty of accountability groups to join and productivity workshops too…

## 7\. There's Support for Personal Development

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/26n6PxXCcE7d1O7Go&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;If you've been at this entrepreneurship game for any amount of time, you've probably started to realize that success isn't just about hard work and the perfect funnel, it has a lot more to do with personal and interpersonal skills.&amp;nbsp;

Creating something out of nothing takes grit, perserverance, and a constant ability to problem-solve. The website and the ads are often the easy part. What actually prevents most businesses from succeeding and breaks apart founding teams? Poor communication and a lack of self-awareness.

Fortunately, Chiang Mai is an incredible place to do the self work that can prime you for, not just professional success, but greater satisfaction in life. Whether your brand of woo woo leans more towards crystals or NLP, you'll find plenty of experts, coaches, and support groups.

Thailand's well-known as a destination for spirituality and wellness, and something of this manages to seep into the day to day of life here, no matter which crowd you run with. People here talk about setting boundaries, self-care, meditation and emotional intelligence in the same breath they lay out their plans for taking over the world (or their highly lucrative niche).

Eat healthy, wholesome food, go vegan or Paleo. Try yoga, Crossfit or pole dance. Go to a bio-hacking meetup, embark on a silent meditation retreat, or delve into Thai massage. When it comes to nurturing the mind, body, and spirit, Chiang Mai's got you covered.

## 8\. The Food is Goddamn Delicious

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/l4Ep4zc3Mgz1ERf1e&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Speaking of healthy eating - how has it taken us so long to get to Thai food? Chiang Mai has Thai food in abundance, and it's all delicious and affordable. Thanks to fresh quality ingredients, a lot of it's pretty damn good for you too.

Have you tried Chiang Mai's signature dish, *kao soi*, yet? A creamy, mildly spiced broth and slippery delicious egg noodles paired with fall-off-the-bone braised meat? Yuuummmm. Or *sai ua* sausages filled with spices and herbs? They pair with sticky rice a treat\!

And then there's Thai fruit, the bounty of the tropics knows no bounds, and there's nothing like enjoying fresh fruit at its seasonal best, whether that's mangos and mangosteen or lychee and longan. It's mouthwatering stuff, be excited.

And if you're a soulless monster and Thai food's not your thing? Well, you can still eat really well here, and for a fraction of what you might expect to spend at home. We've got brunch spots with avocado toast, fancy French restaurants, sublime sushi, and damn good tacos too.

If you fancy a taste of home, there are plenty of Western style supermarkets stocked with many things you'd expect from Publix or M&amp;S (but it might cost you a pretty penny thanks to import duties).

For those focused on maximizing their productivity, you can get healthy meal deliveries and lots of coworking spaces either have restaurants onsite or they hook you up with vendors nearby so you don't even need to leave your desk (though we recommend you do so every now and then for rest and variety\!).

Ask anybody who's been here a while why they love Thailand so much, and the food is sure to be part of it. We have it in vast quantities, at great quality and in infinite varieties. After all, you are what you eat, and we spend a significant amount of our lives eating, so when this part's enjoyable and good for you, it's a pretty good foundation for your life, wouldn't you say?

## 9\. A Great Lifestyle is Affordable

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:58%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/OjH4qcqxU2u76&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Food is just one of the many things that is cheap and of good value in Chiang Mai. Essentials like transport, haircuts, and gyms are inexpensive, and even luxuries like dining out, massages and spas are shockingly affordable.

It's not that Chiang Mai is the absolute cheapest place to live, but there are so many options at every pricepoint offering tremendous value for money. You can essentially name your budget for food, whether that's $1 or $100 and there's a place to go in Chiang Mai.

The same applies to finding a place to live. You can rent studio apartments for&amp;nbsp; $150 or enjoy luxury coliving with a pool and coworking space onsite for less than $1000 a month. Name your price and you can find it. Of course, you might struggle to match your exact budget with your desired amenities and neighborhood, but the options and range are plentiful.

Affordability is, of course, important for the digital nomad or location independent entrepreneur for two reasons. The first is that your money can stretch. While the value of the baht is currently up, your money will still go a lot further here than it would if you were living in London or New York while trying to build up your business.

The second reason? Well frankly it gives you the option to work less, if that's what you want. So many of us get sucked into a life built around work at the expense of health, happiness, and personal fulfillment. The ability to ease off the gas for a bit to explore your options and know that you're not going to starve or end up on the street is exactly what you need to start designing your dream life and taking a chance on that business idea or passion project.

## 10\. Arts, Culture, and Creativity Abound

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/K14ddixG848qQ&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Chiang Mai's annual festivals like [Songkran in April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_&amp;#40;Thailand&amp;#41;){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}&amp;nbsp;and [Loy Kratong in October/November](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_Krathong){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;} draw tons of visitors from around the world and absolutely live up to the hype. These are bucket-list items for a reason, and worth fitting into your travel agenda at least once.

Be sure to put [Jai Thep Music and Arts Festival](https://jaithepfestival.com/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, [TEDx Chiang Mai](http://www.tedxchiangmai.com/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, and&amp;nbsp;[Chiang Mai Street Jazz Festival](https://chiangmaistreetjazzfestival.com/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}&amp;nbsp;on your radar for can't be missed Chiang Mai events too.

[Countless other smaller festivals](http://www.paperplanesblog.com/thai-festivals-in-chiang-mai/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;} and artistic gatherings happen across town, and you can enjoy festive vibes every weekend at pop-up markets and the walking street. Art galleries and handicraft workshops abound and Chiang Mai is so well known for all this that it's [officially designated as a &quot;Creative City&quot; by none other than UNESCO](https://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/citylife-articles/chiang-mai-unesco-creative-city/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.&amp;nbsp;

Living amidst all of this creative energy is not only fun for your activity calendar, it's also great for your work. Soak in the inspiration, explore a creative outlet or find artistic collaborators for your projects. Let Chiang Mai's creative streak move you\!

## 11\. It's Easy to Get Around

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:64%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/eAeWHzNNfaCty&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Whether you have only stolen moments in between professional projects or loads of free time to spend, time is still valuable, and you don't want to waste it commuting or being stuck in traffic. Blessedly, Chiang Mai is small and at its absolute worst, you might end up spending forty minutes instead of twenty driving from one end of town to the other.

Try living in Bangkok where it takes half an hour to get anywhere and you can easily lose a third of your day just to travel. If you work from home, this is fine of course, but then what kind of life is that? Being able to get out and explore leads to a fuller, richer life, which is why Chiang Mai's a great choice.

While the city is lacking in good public transport, it's still very easy to get around. Central neighborhoods like the Old City, Nimmanhaemin, and Santitham are highly walkable, with shops and cafes in abundance. With just a bicycle, you can access the majority of the city's amenities.

Rent a motorbike and your options extend even further\! Though it can be dangerous to drive on Thailand's roads, this option is highly recommended. The freedom to get around on your own terms opens the city up tremendously. If you'd rather not face the hazards, no problem. You can [get around on Chiang Mai's public buses](https://www.chiangmaitraveller.com/chiang-mai-public-bus/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, [try the Red Trucks (also known as *songtaews)*](https://tastythailand.com/how-to-take-a-songtaew-red-pick-up-truck-taxi-in-chiang-mai-thailand/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}&amp;nbsp;which function as ad hoc public transport, or [call a taxi via Grab](https://www.grab.com/th/en/download/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;} (the Southeast Asian equivalent of Uber).

## 12\. Easy Visa Options

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:59%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/kr1qjZtoEKYtW&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Yep, we said it and yes we know that some of you long-termers are probably screaming and shaking your heads. Sure there's stuff that can be improved upon, but for the average nomad, things are pretty sweet.

If you've been here a while, you know that it has become harder to spend long stretches of time in Thailand as the immigration department has tightened up visa controls and, ya know, actually enforced rules and such, but compared neighboring Vietnam where you still need to apply for a visa ahead of time, Thailand's nice and simple.

A significant number of passports, especially those from Europe and North America, are able to [enter Thailand visa-free](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand/changes-visa-exempt.php){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}. It's quite common for people to show up, get stamped in, and then simply apply for an extension to add another 30 days to the first 30 you're given, all without ever having to make an embassy appointment or pay a fee. Apply for a tourist visa ahead of time and you can start with 60 days.

If you're coming for the first time or you're a classic digital nomad who's constantly on the go, this is great. For those of you who are more into slow-travel or working to make Chiang Mai your hub, however, Thailand's current visa situation does leave a lot to be desired.

For a loooooong time, it was easy to swan into the country and when your stay was up, just border hop to Mae Sai, Vientiane, Penang, Bali, Hanoi or any number of nearby spots and then mosey back in for a fresh stamp. Alas, these golden years are over. This easy movement is absolutely one of the factors that helped make Chiang Mai a hub for digital nomads, but a little more effort is required these days.

We'll save the details on the many options for extending your stay in Thailand long-term for its own post (Education Visas, the Elite Visa, hacking multiple passports etc.), but the gist is, plan ahead, or plan to keep moving.

Efforts on both the local and national level are in place to push for more nomad-friendly visa options (and you can help these move forward by [contributing to a survey on the Economic Impact of Digital Nomads in Chiang Mai](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceB-ZX_nBstr5P6XExdxofVpxadse-MKrmtuyN6xq2qg5xnw/viewform?usp=sf_link){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}) so while we wait on the government to get immigration in line with national policies for attracting talent, you've got options and [our partners have got your back when it comes to affordable visa services](https://www.facebook.com/mjandco.th/){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## 13\. Blazing-fast WiFi

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/4GXHFvyrWIu6qr2Brk&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Lastly, of course, no list of why Chiang Mai caters so well to digital nomads would be complete without acknowledging the importance of great motherf\*\*\*ing WiFi. It's not optional, and [Chiang Mai's internet speeds](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/thailand){: target=&quot;_blank&quot;}&amp;nbsp;and coverage are solid.

In other nomad hotspots like Bali, coworking spaces offer the antidote to infrastructure issues like power cuts and unreliable WiFi, but in Chiang Mai, you never have to worry. Thailand has an excellent telecom infrastructure and wherever you may wander, you won't be far from WiFi.

It's available for free at nearly all accommodations, cafes, restaurants, massage shops, nail salons, and more. Cheap data-plans and extensive 4G coverage mean that your phone is always connected and can act as a WiFi hotspot too.

At coworking spaces you'll typically have access to multiple networks for backup and those who prefer to work from their home office will have no trouble setting up private internet without the need for a long-term contract. Whether you prefer the phrase &quot;digital nomad&quot; or &quot;location independent&quot; the crux is that you rely on your laptop and WiFi to enable your lifestyle. Chiang Mai has excellent internet, making it an ideal place from which to live and work.

\_\_\_\_\_

Phew\! You made it. It's a long list and a beast of a post, we know.

&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/3oKIPf3C7HqqYBVcCk&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;As locals and natives, perhaps we're a little biased here at CoCo as to all the reasons our city is so great, but it doesn't seem hard to understand why digital nomads have chosen and continue to choose Chiang Mai. It's got everything you need to live, work, play, and lead your best life. And after all, that's what embarking upon this digital nomad path is all about isn't it? Having the freedom and the flexibility to design your dream life.&amp;nbsp;

If you're a newbie nomad, you could do far worse than choose Chiang Mai as base from which to build your business and begin your travels. Those who've been around the block (or rather the globe…) a couple times will continue to find tremendous value in the city, whether it be from its amenities or its talented community.

At CoCo, we're obsessed with our hometown and we want you to love it as much as we do.
