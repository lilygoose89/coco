neighborhood:
  - name: Nimmanhaemin

      Hip and happening, Nimman is where the action centers in the nomad world. Chock-a-block with cafes, coworking spaces, bars, restaurants, and shopping it's got everything you could ask for all within walking distance. If you want to be near all things hip and trendy, with Instagrammable moments around every corner, this is the neighborhood for you. If you couldn't care less about that stuff and you just want to be somewhere super convenient, this is also the neighborhood for you.<br/><br/>The price to pay for being so close to the conveniences is the steady stream of tourists you will live alongside and the drone of flights taking off overhead. That said, this neighborhood still has its quiet parts and though it's thronging with people, things quickly start to feel like home once you've created a routine and you learn when to hit your favorite espresso spot to beat the crowds.<br/><br/>Convenience stores and pharmacies can be found within a minute or two of each other, and for more serious grocery shopping you've got Rimping at Maya Shopping Mall, as well as Makro and Tops on Sirimankalajarn Road. Many nomad-friendly events and meetups are hosted in the area, and you also have access to bars and nightlife.
