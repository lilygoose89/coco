  The Oldtale is a boutique hotel-come-coliving located in a quiet neighborhood
  near the railway station. Once the grand home of a colonial-era factory
  overseer, you can still see traces of the original architecture in the high
  ceilings, preserved columns, and handsome wooden staircase.<br/><br/>
  Renovated in an eclectic and colorful style, the first floor of The Oldtale
  offers ample space to live, work and hang out. Guests have access to a full
  kitchen stocked with basics and unlimited coffee! A continental breakfast is
  served every morning and family dinners area weekly highlight.<br/><br/> While
  the first floor cafe and coworking are open to the public, the upstairs is a
  private space just for residents. With fewer than ten rooms, this property has
  a homey communal vibe and offers everything you need under one roof.

neighborhood:
  - name: Wat Ket
    description: >-
      A charming historical neighborhood, Wat Ket is off-the-beaten-path for the
      average nomad, but offers easy access to the Old City and Superhighway.
      The area is up and coming, with hip cafes and concept spaces beginning to
      emerge, but is still very essentially Thai and local. Your nearest
      7-Eleven is at the top of the road within walking distance. For groceries
      and shopping, head to Central Festival which is less than 10 minutes away
      by motorbike or car.
