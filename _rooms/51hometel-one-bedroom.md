  Clean, comfortable and quiet, make yourself at home at 51hometel. Offering apartment-style living, this property is great for both short and long stays. The owner is an interior designer by training and has renovated this space in a clean, bright, and modern style. An all-inclusive rate, housekeeping and access to the lobby coworking space adds excellent value for money. Guests can also take advantage of laundry services or visit their cafe and donut shop next door. You have everything you need at home.<br/><br/>51hometel is located little ways away from the action, so you'll want to rent a motorbike to get around or nab one of their free bicycles, but the neighborhood is quiet and has a very local and Thai feeling. Within walking distance you'll find restaurants, bakeries and a highly popular gym. Hope on a motorbike and you'll be in Nimman or the Old city in just 5 minutes.

neighborhood:
  - name: Chang Puak
    description: >-
      North of the Old City, Chang Puak is a densely packed residential neighborhood that runs from Chang Puak Gate to the superhighway. Businesses line the main drag of Chang Puak Road from which a maze of streets branch and wind. The area is very Thai with few businesses catering specifically to tourists - the cheaper prices offerred reflect this. 7-11s, convenience stores, pharmacies and little shops are dotted all around. The largest Westerm-style shopping area in this zone is the Tops supermarket located next to the Novotel. Locals, however, shop at the huge Kat Thanin fresh market nearby which offers fresh produce, meats, and prepared foods as well as household essentials, clothing, and more. Also in this neighborhood is Go Gym, an open air gym highly popular with nomads and expats.
