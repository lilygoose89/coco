Thailand's second city and its undisputed cultural capital. Take a gander at the endless temples and scenic mountains and it's no wonder why Chiang Mai draws millions of visitors a year. Once you taste your first kao soi or sai-ua sausage, you'll also start to understand why many never leave.

But why is it that digital nomads are so obsessed with Chiang Mai? While its ranking wobbles up and down seasonally, you'll almost always [find Chiang Mai topping the charts on the like of Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/best-cities-for-digital-nomads){: target="_blank"}, and anyone who's been "nomadding" it up for a while is sure to have the city on their radar.

There are scores of blog posts and videos on the topic, so to make this worth publishing, we're gonna help add some context. We've got your classic checklist for essntial reading, but we'll also give you the why of it.

Any nincompoop can show up and get a good sense of the why for themselves (or hire someone on Upwork to research and regurgitate their own version of course), but with our history here, we hope to add a little more nuance. How did these things come about, how have they changed over time, and how unique are these factors really?

So without further ado, here are the ten reasons why Chiang Mai is such a beloved digital nomad hotspot.

## Well-Developed Travel Insfrastructure

Let's start with a big round of applause for dear old CNX. For those not in the know, that's the airport code for Chiang Mai International Airport, the gateway to the city.

It's a given that good airport connections are important to the location independent entrepreneur with a penchant for country-hopping, so the ability to come and go easily is one of the top reasons for Chiang Mai's popularity.

It might seem like a small thing, but heading out to the airport from other Thai cities like takes time. Bangkok? Good luck getting in or out during rush hour which last basically half the day. Phuket? Pattaya? That's a looooong drive my friend. Anywhere in the islands? You've got ferries to contend with if not also extra connecting flights.

In Chiang Mai, most of us live within 30 minutes of the airport. 30 minutes is also about the time you typically need to allot to going through security (if you're fond of living on the edge). It's pretty easy breezy all around.

[CNX takes you directly to most anywhere you want to go in Thailand and tons more destinations abroad](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-chiang-mai-cnx){: target="_blank"} courtesy of Air Asia and other budget-friendly airlines.&nbsp; Coming here from North America or Europe? You might be able to get away with just a single layover thanks to long-hauls from the likes of Emirates, Korean Air (codeshared with Delta), EVA Air, and Cathay Pacific.

While you may be maddened by the noise of airplanes constantly flying overhead when you're living here, its the price we pay to be able to so effortlessly hop and bop around Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Essential for a city that caters to the nomad set.

## Great Weather

Thailand is a sunny, tropical destination. Do we really need to explain further? Temperatures range from a sizzling 36&deg;C in the summer ([which we very sensibly cope with by breaking out into a city-wide water fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_&#40;Thailand&#41;){: target="_blank"}) to an adorably nippy 15&deg;C during "winter" nights and mornings.

Seasonal Affective Disorder is real folks, and if you ditched the rat race to pursue health and happiness, the last thing you want to do is live somewhere that predisposes you to depression. Chiang Mai is fortunately the opposite of the gloomy conditions you get used to in Europe or North America . [We get sunshine at least 150 hours a month, but usually it's almost twice that](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,Chiang-Mai,Thailand){: target="_blank"}. That's basically free therapy right there.&nbsp;

Great weather is also great for being in the outdoors, whether that's lounging by the pool on hot days or searching for waterfalls hidden in the jungle on a crisp morning trek.

That said, we Thais believe in airconditioning, so you're always able to escape mother nature at will and choose your own temperatures. Your coworking and accommodations will almost certainly come with aircon.

High season for tourism corresponds closely with the time of year when digital nomads are in Chiang Mai, from November through February. It's the best time to be here. Sunny warm days and refreshingly cool evenings and nights when you might even - gasp\! - want a sweater.

## Beautiful Natural Surroundings

As mentioned above, Chiang Mai's great weather lends itself to fun in the outdoors, and you absolutely must get out into the scenic countryside and hills of the province.

Just as it's easy to board a flight and go anywhere from Chiang Mai, it's also incredibly easy to escape the city for a change of scenery. Hop on a motorbike or book a redtruck and drive in any-direction - within 30 minutes or less you'll find yourself zipping past rice-fields or winding along mountain roads.

We have a very robust cafe culture in Thailand, and if there's a view point or something pretty we'll stick a cafe next to it. Quite probably there'll be free WiFi as well, so all these escapes into the countryside need not come at the expense of your work or clients.

If you truly do want to escape though, there are jungle homestays, remote retreats, and temble-based Vippassanas in abundance so it's very easy to unplug in order to commune with nature and the spirits and what-have-you.

Few travellers come all the way to Thailand without taking advantage of its natural delights, but it has been our experience that an astonishing number of digital nomads miss out on this aspect entirely, spending all their time within the few blocks that surround their apartment and coworking space.

Those that fall in love with Chiang Mai often cite nature, the mountains and our beautiful surroundings as one of the city's most enchanting qualities, so we highly recommend making the time to truly experience it.

## Friendly People

Truly connecting with Thailand also means connecting with its people. Known as the Land of Smiles, this moniker is one visitors can easily confirm. Hospitality and manners are deeply important to Thais and the country has long been developed for tourism, so everywhere you go you can find friendly people ready to help you.

Beyond the gracious hospitality, Thais have a very live and let live attitude that makes it easy for people from very different backgrounds to feel like they have a place here. While the behavior of Westerners may often elicit a raised eyebrow, it will be accompanied by the Thai smile.

For the oddballs, geeks, and outsiders who never feel like they fit in at home, Chiang Mai is a haven, and the city boasts a very eclectic and intellectual expat community. For anybody who's just bursting with creative expression or just likes to be a little outrageous, welcome, you will find your weirdos here.&nbsp;

Thai people are very friendly, but it's also the long-standing expat community that makes Chiang Mai such a great place for digital nomads. The first wave of this movement were the tech workers who relocated to Chiang Mai
