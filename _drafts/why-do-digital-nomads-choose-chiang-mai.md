Thailand's second city and its undisputed cultural capital. Take a gander at the endless temples and scenic mountains and it's no wonder why Chiang Mai draws millions of visitors a year. Once you taste your first kao soi or sai-ua sausage, you'll also start to understand why many never leave.

But why is it that digital nomads are so obsessed with Chiang Mai? While its ranking wobbles up and down seasonally, you'll almost always [find Chiang Mai topping the charts on the like of Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/best-cities-for-digital-nomads){: target="_blank"}, and anyone who's been "nomadding" it up for a while is sure to have the city on their radar.

There are scores of blog posts and videos on the topic, so to make this worth publishing, we're gonna help add some context. We've got your classic checklist for essntial reading, but we'll also give you the why of it.

Any nincompoop can show up and get a good sense of the why for themselves (or hire someone on Upwork to research and regurgitate their own version of course), but with our history here, we hope to add a little more nuance. How did these things come about, how have they changed over time, and how unique are these factors really?

So without further ado, here are the ten reasons why Chiang Mai is such a beloved digital nomad hotspot.

## Well-Developed Travel Insfrastructure

Let's start with a big round of applause for dear old CNX. For those not in the know, that's the airport code for Chiang Mai International Airport, the gateway to the city.

It's a given that good airport connections are important to the location independent entrepreneur with a penchant for country-hopping, so the ability to come and go easily is one of the top reasons for Chiang Mai's popularity.

It might seem like a small thing, but heading out to the airport from other Thai cities like takes time. Bangkok? Good luck getting in or out during rush hour which last basically half the day. Phuket? Pattaya? That's a looooong drive my friend. Anywhere in the islands? You've got ferries to contend with if not also extra connecting flights.

In Chiang Mai, most of us live within 30 minutes of the airport. 30 minutes is also about the time you typically need to allot to going through security (if you're fond of living on the edge). It's pretty easy breezy all around.

[CNX takes you directly to most anywhere you want to go in Thailand and tons more destinations abroad](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-chiang-mai-cnx){: target="_blank"} courtesy of Air Asia and other budget-friendly airlines.&nbsp; Coming here from North America or Europe? You might be able to get away with just a single layover thanks to long-hauls from the likes of Emirates, Korean Air (codeshared with Delta), EVA Air, and Cathay Pacific.

While you may be maddened by the noise of airplanes constantly flying overhead when you're living here, its the price we pay to be able to so effortlessly hop and bop around Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Essential for a city that caters to the nomad set.

## Great Weather

Thailand is a sunny, tropical destination. Do we really need to explain further? Temperatures range from a sizzling 36&deg;C in the summer ([which we very sensibly cope with by breaking out into a city-wide water fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_&#40;Thailand&#41;){: target="_blank"}) to an adorably nippy 15&deg;C during "winter" nights and mornings.

Seasonal Affective Disorder is real folks, and if you ditched the rat race to pursue health and happiness, the last thing you want to do is live somewhere&nbsp;

Thais actually love escaping to the north's colder climes during the "winter" when the thermometer ranges between 29&deg;C / 15&deg;C , so it's a thing, even if it's all relative.

## Beautiful Natural Surroundings

## Friendly People

Thais have a live and let live attitude that makes it easy for people to feel like they fit in, even when they don't.

## Delicious Food

## Low Cost of Living

## A Great Place to Connect With Talent

## Blazing-fast WiFi

## Easy Visa Options for Longstays
