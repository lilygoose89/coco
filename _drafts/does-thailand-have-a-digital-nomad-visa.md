Digital nomads represent a growing class of long-stay tourist who ought to be seen as desirable by governments. Most remote-workers and entrepreneurs are highly-skilled, earning their income from outside the country and injecting it into the local economy via apartment rentals, coworking passes, posh brunches, and a bottomless appetite for coffee. Nomads drink less than the typical tourist, and unlike retirees, they don't burden the healthcare system.

While no official public announcements have been made to date, this is a priority item for [NIA, BOI, DEPA and other government agencies with a stake in Thailand's digital future](https://startupchiangmai.com/thai-government-agencies-startups){: target="_blank"}.
