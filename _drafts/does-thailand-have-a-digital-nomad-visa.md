The responsible traveler who likes to plan things (so they don't, you know, get denied entry and deported and stuff) may wonder "how do digital nomads live in Chiang Mai long term?" or "does Thailand have a special visa for digital nomads?"

The short answers are "by skirting immigration laws and bending visa restrictions" and "no."

Given Thailand's popularity both as a stop on round-the-world tours and a long-term base for location-independent workers, this may come as a surprise. Those who have spent some time in the kingdom, however, will know that grey areas in laws and enforcement are pretty normal here.

## Is Thailand Creating a Visa for Digital Nomads?

While there was much excitement leading up to the SMART Visa scheme announced in 2017, it did not turn out to be the long-wished for solution desired by digital nomads (more on that below). That said, Thailand has been moving quickly to update visa schemes and policies designed to encourage knowledge transfer and foreign investment. Freelancers and remote tech-workers in particular could well be the beneficiaries of an expanded SMART Visa program.

The highly opinionated mind behind this blog is willing to bet you that in a year's time, Thailand will have issued some type of visa solution for digital nomads.

Digital nomads represent a growing class of long-stay tourist who ought to be seen as desirable by governments. Most remote-workers and entrepreneurs are highly-skilled, earning their income from outside the country and injecting it into the local economy via apartment rentals, coworking passes, posh brunches, and a bottomless appetite for coffee. Nomads engage in fewer risky behaviors (like drinking) than the typical tourist, and unlike retirees, they're unlikely to become an uninsured burden on the healthcare system.

DNs also have access to something that governments in countries trying to bridge the development gap desperately want: knowledge. Thailand is making a big bid to digitize and position itself as the startup capital of Southeast Asia. To achieve ambitious targets, homegrown talent won't be enough. Thailand wants and needs entrepreneurs, investors, and highly-skilled workers.

The people who are digital nomads today are exceptionally privileged. Thanks to higher-education, digital literacy, and strong passports, digital nomads can choose how they want to live and work. The countries that are able to attract this demographic is going to have a big advantage in the coming years. It's why countries like Germany, Estonia, Georgia, Malaysia and more are creating visa and residency schemes to seduce the wandering digital worker to stay a little longer.

Thailand's technocrats are educated and savvy and while the messiness of politics in this country tends has a tendency to ham-string public servants, make no mistake, highly influential parties are already hard at work.

While no official public announcements have been made to date, this is a priority item for [NIA, BOI, DEPA and other government agencies with a stake in Thailand's digital future](https://startupchiangmai.com/thai-government-agencies-startups){: target="_blank"}. We look forward to reporting back on this in the coming months as details emerge.

For those who are ready to move to Thailand now or can't afford to just wait around though, what are the current alternatives?

In the next section, we'll break down the top visa options for digital nomads in Thailand, explain some of the who and hows, and link you to recommended resources for further reading or assistance.

## A Digital Nomad's Visa Options in Thailand

For a little background, here's a list of the visa and residency options used by digital nomads to live and work in Thailand:

* Tourist Visa
* Business Visa
* Education Visa
* Elite Visa
* SMART Visa

Choosing the right visa option for you depends on 1) how long you want to stay in Thailand, 2) what country your passport is from and 3) where you're currently located. How much you have to spend on a visa and visa services is also relevant, but that mostly applies to those who want to be in Thailand long term.

According to a recent survey on *The Economic Impact of Digital Nomads*, 86% of digital nomads have entered Thailand on a tourist visa (thanks to the [Chiang Mai Entrepreneurship Association](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ChiangMaiEntrepreneurs/about/){: target="_blank"} for putting out the survey and sharing their data with us\!). If Thailand is but one stop on your world tour or you're just dipping your toes into this lifestyle, a simple tourist visa is your best option.

For those wanting to stay longer in the country, education visas come in handy, and survey results indicate that 24% of nomads in Chiang Mai take advantage of this option. 16% are here longer term on non-immigrant visas of various description, while 12% of digital nomads have a non-immigrant business visa.

## Digital Nomad Guide to Tourist Visas for Thailand

Tourist visas are designed for - you guessed it - tourists\! And if you're not planning to live in Thailand long term, this is you, even if "tourist" is an adjective that sticks in your craw. These include single-entry tourist visas, multiple-entry tourist visas, and visa-exempt entry (also just called "stamps").

Designed to encourage travel to tourist-friendly Thailand, these are super easy to get. You can apply through consulates and embassies around the world, or if you're from one of [64 countries](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand/changes-visa-exempt.php){: target="_blank"}, you can just show up and get a visa-exemption stamp upon arrival. This gives you permission to spend a minimum of 30 days in Thailand, with possibilities to extend for a longer stay.

If you apply for extensions and are smart about doing border hops and visa runs, you might be able to game the system to get 6 months in Thailand. If your itinerary includes travel to neighboring countries, you can easily build this into your plan.

To enjoy greater flexibility though, apply for a multiple-entry tourist visa from your home country. While it used to be possible to apply for the METV whilst abroad, Thai embassies around the world have cracked down on this. The METV allows you to spend 4 or 6 months in Thailand ([some passports can even get a year](https://www.siam-legal.com/thailand-visa/1-Year-Thailand-Visa.php){: target="_blank"}) though you will still be required to apply for extensions and do border runs.

For those already outside their home country or considering options for staying a little longer in Thailand, it is possible to apply for a single-entry tourist visa from outside your home country. For those already in Thailand, Laos and Malaysia are the most popular destinations (pro-tip for those going to Vientiane, Laos be aware that appointments have to be booked in advance these days\!). The cost to apply for a visa varies depending on the embassy, but is typically under $50.

If you've been in and out of Thailand for a while, do keep in mind that its more common now for immigration to use computer systems to tally your time in Thailand and those with many stamps in and out or who have already spent more than a cumulative 6 months in the kingdom may get hassled at the border. Sometimes this results in more questions and a stern warning, sometimes a jokey suggestion it may be time to wife up and get a marriage visa, or in some cases, being turned away entirely and forced to buy a flight out of the country. Yes, for real.

To restate though, if you're coming to Thailand for the first time and you're planning to send no more than 3 months here, you can basically skip the rest of this article and go straight to the tips and tricks. Entering the country should be a breeze for you.

There's a lot of advice online that will make it seem like getting a visa for Thailand is difficult or stressful, but that's only for people who have been coming here for years or are trying to stay long-term, i.e., they're no longer tourist. It's easy for tourists to come to Thailand, so don't stress.

## Business Visas for Digital Nomads in Thailand

Most "business visas" issued in Thailand are for employment. In other words, a local company wants to employ a foreigner so they need to issue that person a visa. This is just not relevant to most nomads.

The other type of business visa is the Non-Immigrant B Visa (Conducting Business) which is for "[foreigners who wish to setup or conduct business in Thailand](https://www.siam-legal.com/thailand-visa/business-visa-thailand.php){: target="_blank"}," so again probably not relevant for most digital nomads.

If you're looking to make Thailand a base and you wish to operate a business in the kingdom, or your work requires you to make frequent business trips to Thailand, then this may be the visa option for you.

Bear in mind there'll be tons of fun paperwork involved to confirm your financials, travel itinerary and more. If you're self-employed then you'll almost certainly have to register a company in Thailand which involves lawyers and accountant and more paperwork. In order to legally work in Thailand, foreigners also need a work permit along with the appropriate visa. Yay, even more paperwork\!

If you're a digital nomad who feels icky about the idea of "working illegally" in Thailand and thinks that getting a business visa will be the answer - it's&nbsp;*probably -&nbsp;*not worth the hassle. But we're not lawyers at CoCo, if you want a definitive answer consult a lawyer\! Searching for answers on the internet is more likely to lead you to a visa forum circle-jerk rather than a clear answer.&nbsp;

Do note that if you're in Thailand on a typical business trip, you're fine. Thai authorities are not out to get you. People come to the country all the time for conferences, business meetings and the like on tourist visas with the intent to do business. That said, it is probably still simplest to mark the Purpose of Visit on your arrival card as "holiday" to avoid hassle.
