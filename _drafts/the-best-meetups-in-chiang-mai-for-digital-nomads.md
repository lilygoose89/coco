Everybody's gotta have friends, and few things are more painful and awkward than making friends as an adult. When you're living a lifestyle that has you constantly on the go and you don't settle in to any one social circle, boy oh boy does this get even harder.&nbsp;

Most adult friend groups are formed at work and in the absence of an office, coworking spaces can be the next best thing. People go to coworking spaces to, well, work though, so still it's not the most conducive to having the conversations that lay the groundwork for becoming best pals. Sooooo what's a lonely nomad starved for social interaction to do?

Welcome to Chiang Mai, land of meetups\! If you want to hang out with your fellow location-independent peoples in an environment designed for socializing and bonding over shared interests, here's a list of the best meetups in Chiang Mai for meeting digital nomads.

## Remote Collective Popup Coworking

Hosted once a week during "the season" (roughly September through February), this popup event takes over a cafe or coworking space in the city. Free to attend, this is great place to meet new people or to connect with those you've met but haven't yet had a chance really speak with.

Remote Collective is a media brand and led by the inimitable Brittnee Bond, and if you've ever been to one of her events, you know she's gonna make you talk and open up. At the popup coworking days, she invites attendees to share a little about themselves and what they're working on, so it's a great place to get a sense of what others are doing and find potential collaborators.

After the initial intros though, everybody is free to hang out and focus on work as they choose, or connect further and enjoy chitchatting. People come to work, to have meetings or just for the social aspect, it's super low key so you can decide what feels best for you.

This year the popup coworking days have been held every Thursday in the lobby of the drop-dead gorgeous Home Chiang Mai Hotel. Check the Remote Collective Facebook Page for the latest details and to RSVP.

## Chiang Mai Entrepreneurs Meetup

A good networking has to have either alcohol or activities, and this monthly meetup has both. Billed as "the networking event for people who don't like networking," this meetup happens every second Friday of the month at Burisiri Hotel (which happens to be a super chilled coworking space by day).&nbsp;

The Chiang Mai Entrepreneurship Association (CMEA) which hosts these has a stated aim to build a bridge between Thai, expat, and nomad entrepreneur communities, so you get a more diverse mix of people than at your standard digital nomad event.&nbsp;

If you're interested to learn more about the city, connect with local business owners and diversify your network, this is the meetup for you. Participants can join the event for just a 100baht cover and in addition to the usual mixing and mingling, they also facilitate "Speed Networking." While it may sound intimidating, the format is actually great for getting past the usual awkwardness of networking and making quality connections in a short amount of time.&nbsp;

CMEA is also the group currently lobbying the government for a digital nomad visa and they also have ties to startup agencies and institutions, so if you've thought about building a business base in Thailand or tapping into local resources, they're the people to talk to.

RSVP at the Chiang Mai Entrepreneurship Association's Facebook Event.

## CNX Social

Also held at the Burisiri Hotel, the CNX Socials happen every other Friday also during "the season." Super laid back, these are organized by the vivacious Serena and tend to draw an eclectic crowd.

With no set agenda, the meetup has a totally chilled out vibe and hey, if you want to jump in the pool, no one minds so long as you're dressed for it\!

Many a new best-friend group has formed at this gathering and while the attendees aren't necessarily all digital nomads, there's a strong feeling of being with yout&nbsp;

Stay tuned to their Facebook Page for event updates. CNX Social also puts on other great nomad-focused social events and professional workshops.
