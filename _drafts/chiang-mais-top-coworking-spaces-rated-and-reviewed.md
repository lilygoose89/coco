Chiang Mai's many coworking spaces are one of the top reasons the city is so popular with digital nomads. While you can access fast internet from just about anywhere in Thailand, coworking offers three main benefits for the location-independent entrepreneur or remote worker.

The main reason people cowork is to be in an environment that's conducive to work. Some people get shit done at home, but for others, it's way too easy to get distracted by the TV, the pile of dishes that need to be done, or a wonderful but distracting partner.

With an environment that signals office vibes and creates zones for different types of work (desks in a quiet room for focused work, Skype cubicles, meeting rooms, chill zones for socializing etc.) we can use less brainpower just trying to stay focused and more on executing the work itself.

For those of us that work on the road, coworking spaces are also essential because we know that we can count on the amenities we need to be productive. Many cafes can be great to work in, but not all of them have enough outlets or strong wifi. When you need to get shit done, you want to know that you can count on strong, stable internet and suitable workspace.&nbsp;

And the third reason coworking spaces are so great? The people\! Coworking spaces act as focal points that bring together like-minded people. Spaces that host events and facilitate networking add tremendous value to their communities because can connect to form friendships and to collaborate and build businesses.
