Chiang Mai's many coworking spaces are one of the top reasons the city is so popular with digital nomads. While you can access fast internet from just about anywhere in Thailand, coworking offers three main benefits for the location-independent entrepreneur or remote worker.

The main reason people cowork is to be in an environment that's conducive to work. Some people get shit done at home, but for others, it's way too easy to get distracted by the TV, the pile of dishes that need to be done, or a wonderful but distracting partner.

With an environment that signals office vibes and creates zones for different types of work (desks in a quiet room for focused work, Skype cubicles, meeting rooms, chill zones for socializing etc.) we can use less brainpower just trying to stay focused and more on executing the work itself.

For those of us that work on the road, coworking spaces are also essential because we know that we can count on the amenities we need to be productive. Many cafes can be great to work in, but not all of them have enough outlets or strong wifi. When you need to get shit done, you want to know that you can count on strong, stable internet and suitable workspace.&nbsp;

And the third reason coworking spaces are so great? The people\! Coworking spaces act as focal points that bring together like-minded people. Spaces that host events and facilitate networking add tremendous value to their communities because can connect to form friendships and to collaborate and build businesses.

If you're looking to tap into the magic of coworking in Chiang Mai, we've got a list of the top coworking spaces around town along with details about the benefits they offer or who they're most suited to.

Along with important details like location and price, we'll also be rating spaces based on the following criteria: 1 Workspace, 2) Ambiance/Environment 3) Amenities and 4) Community.

Get ready, you're in for another beast of a post\! Here's a handy table of contents to skip through the places already on your radar:

## Punspace

By far Chiang Mai's largest and most popular coworking brand, Punspace was founded in 2013 with their first Nimman branch and have since grown to a total of three locations across the city. These guys have been doing the coworking things for a while and they do it right.

With hot desks for monthly members and drop-ins as well as private offices for small teams and startups, Punspace is a full-service coworking company. Each of the spaces has a different feel and vibe, but you can count on great internet, workspaces with desks and ergonomic chairs, Skype booths, and meeting rooms along with coffee and drinking water included.

Due to its location, the original Nimman branch is quite popular, but that also makes it crowded. While the vibe here is great for getting work done and also meeting people, those who get distracted by a lot of nearby humans might not like this location.

The Thae Pae branch is the largest and most spacious, with a hip warehouse-y vibe. Sharing the same building is a Burkta Cafe and Makerspace Thailand, a cool fabrication space where you can work with 3D printers, laser cutters and power tools.

Punspace Wiang Kaew in the Old City is their newest location and our personal favorite. With a large grassy courtyard and trees, it feels like an oasis in the city. When you need a break from work you can go sit in the hammock, grab coffee and lunch at the onsite cafes or pop into the zero-waste refill store. Also on this campus is Chiang Mai & Co, a one-top service for SMART Visa and business-services that is an active core of Chiang Mai's startup scene.

If you want a proper desk and professional amenities, and you'd enjoy the convenience of access to multiple spaces, then a membership at Punspace is just the ticket. If you're turned off by work places that are full of dudes though, then Punspace might not be your vibe.

Punspace have an active community and host tons of workshops and networking events, but the staff are pretty hands off, meaning that the quality of the workshop depends on the professionalism of the presenter - and when it comes to networking there's no real facilitation, so you'll have to rely on your own social skills or hope for a good group and organic experience.&nbsp;

## Hub53

Another firm favorite of the Chiang Mai coworking scene, Hub53 is a coliving and coworking space located on the western edge of Nimmanhaemin along the Canal Road.

One of the best things about Hub53 is it's small, which makes for a friendly and well-connected community. One of the worst things about Hub53 is that it's small, so being elbow to elbow with people you're really good friends with becomes hella distracting.

In terms of amenities, they have good desks, chairs and plenty of outlets. They offer bookable Skype rooms (suitable for those who teach online), a meeting room, plus a projector for running workshops in the evenings.

A great perk is the espresso machine and unlimited coffee, Hub53 also have a great smoothie and salad bar onsite which you can order from without even having to leave the coworking space\!

If you're into coliving, this is one of the few on offer in Chiang Mai, but fair warning rooms are small, limited, and often booked out way in advance.

Hub53 also have an active events calendar and they're a great venue to partner with if you want to put on a workshop or meetup.
