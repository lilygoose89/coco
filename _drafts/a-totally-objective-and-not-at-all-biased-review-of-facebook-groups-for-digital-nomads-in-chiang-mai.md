Facebook groups might just be the single most valuable resource a nomad new to Chiang Mai has. Nomad List kills it with all their live-feeds and data and many a wise blogger has spent time in Chiang Mai and shared their insights with the world, but still these groups are damn useful.

Getting answers from a human instead of Google ~~is lazy~~ feels nice, but living in a new city, you're also likely to encounter situations which are common enough that other humans have likely been through them, but wayyyyy too specific for even those most niched-down content creator to bother with.

That said, it's dangerous stuff wandering in the online world with strangers, and not all of them are kind or reliable. On the internets, there be trolls a plenty, and even when people are nice… They may be well-intentioned but are straight up ~~idiots~~ terrible at communicating.

If you're trying to research Chiang Mai for the next stop on your nomad tour or&nbsp; you're newly arrived and trying to settle in, here's are some Facebook groups you might consider joining and some suggestions, caveats and warnings about what they're like.
