Facebook groups might just be the single most valuable resource a nomad new to Chiang Mai has. Nomad List kills it with all their live-feeds and data and many a wise blogger has spent time in Chiang Mai and shared their insights with the world, but still these groups are damn useful.

Getting answers from a human instead of Google ~~is lazy~~ feels nice, but living in a new city, you're also likely to encounter situations which are common enough that other humans have likely been through them, but wayyyyy too specific for even those most niched-down content creator to bother with.

That said, it's dangerous stuff wandering in the online world with strangers, and not all of them are kind or reliable. On the internets, there be trolls a plenty, and even when people are nice… They may be well-intentioned but are straight up ~~idiots~~ terrible at communicating.

If you're trying to research Chiang Mai for the next stop on your nomad tour or&nbsp; you're newly arrived and trying to settle in, here's are some Facebook groups you might consider joining and some suggestions, caveats and warnings about what they're like.

But before we start, we want to give you the one super useful tip that will make your life a whole lot easier and keep you on group admins' good side. Search\!

When looking at a group on your web-browser, you'll see the search bar on the left options panel:

In mobile, this lives at the top of the page when you're within the group:

Repetitive questions can bring down the quality of the group (and open you up to newbie-bashing by trolls). Since most situations are not entirely unique to you, help others help you by helping yourself first and check that someone's not already taken the time to provide an answer to your question.
