## Nimmanhaemin

**The basic bitch of Chiang Mai neighborhoods. But that's ok, basic is also essential, and you've got everything you need in this hip, central part of town.**

Condos are plentiful and come with all the amenities you need. A house is harder to come by, but not impossible. The unceasing torrent of Chinese tourists might be a drag, but hey - everything is in walking distance\! From coworking and trendy cafes to shopping malls and nightlife, Nimman's got it all.

If you're new to town, you could do far worse than setting yourself up here. The only downsides are you'll be tempted to spend like it's Monopoly money so watch your budget. And oh, get some good earplugs and noise-cancelling headphones because those flights out of CNX go straight overhead.

## Santitham

## Chang Puak

## Old City

## Jed Yod

## Suan Dok

## Suthep/CMU

## Pong Noi

## Wat Ket

## Wua Lai

## Chang Klan

All the benefits of a nom-friendly location like Nimman, without the glut of other nomads. Most of Chang Klan is a mix of upper-class Thai homes, luxury apartments and hyper-touristy hangouts.

As with everywhere in Chiang Mai, name your price and you can find&nbsp;*something*&nbsp;if you search hard enough, but you're probably going to splash out a fair bit on rent ...

## The 'Burbs

**Hang Dong, Mae Hia, Saraphi, San Phisua, Mae Rim and more...**

You've gone native at this point, or you're here with a family and need the big house, nearby schools and all that entails. Broaden your horizons and your housing search to these neighborhoods and you'll be rewarded with a far richer, more local experience.

With nary a nomad in sight, you can spend your time getting to know life like your Thai neighbors do. This comes with the accompanying challenges of sorting out your day to day life in areas where people expect you to speak the language, but you've already got that down hey?

If living out in the suburbs, you'll absolutely need a motorbike, if not a car. In exchange for the commute though, enjoy the room to spread out in your large house and yard for cheaper than some studios in the city.
