What's the best time to be in Chiang Mai as a digital nomad? No matter the time of year, the city's got plenty to offer the wandering entrepreneur or remote worker, but there's definitely peak seasons if you want to maximize your chance to connect with like-minded fellows.

The unofficial "season" for nomads in Chiang Mai typically run from September to February, with a definite peak in nomadic-type humans and nomad-focused events in December and January.

If you've got a tight schedule and you're wondering if you'll be able to connect with other nomads and find fun stuff to do during the time you had in mind - have no fear\! There are digital nomads and interesting expats to be found in Chiang Mai year-round. Just show up at a coworking space and you're sure to be able to connect with people and make friends. While there might not be quite as many meetups and events during the off-season, Chiang Mai is a big enough city that there's always something going on.
