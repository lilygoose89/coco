What's the best time to be in Chiang Mai as a digital nomad? No matter the time of year, the city's got plenty to offer the wandering entrepreneur or remote worker, but there's definitely peak seasons if you want to maximize your chance to connect with like-minded fellows and go to great events.

The unofficial "season" for nomads in Chiang Mai typically run from September to February, with a definite peak in nomadic-type humans and nomad-focused events in December and January.

If you've got a tight schedule and you're wondering if you'll be able to connect with other nomads and find fun stuff to do during the time you had in mind - have no fear\! There are digital nomads and interesting expats to be found in Chiang Mai year-round. Just show up at a coworking space and you're sure to be able to connect with people and make friends. While there might not be quite as many meetups and events during the off-season, Chiang Mai is a big enough city that there's always something going on.

For those with the freedom to plan their timings and travels though, here are some events (good and bad\!) that you may want to keep in mind before you book your next flight to Chiang Mai.

## Nomad Summit (January)

Exactly what it says on the tin, the Nomad Summit is a roving conference that brings together digital nomads and those curious about the lifestyle to gather and share knowledge and experience. Founded in Chiang Mai, this event occasionally takes place in other corners of the globe, but it has returned home each year since its conception in 2015.

**In 2020, the Summit runs from January 17-21st**. If you want to learn how to make it as a nomad, then this is the event for you\! Seasoned entrepreneurs and travelers take the stage to share tips, tricks and tactics for growing wealth and building businesses while traveling long term. The main ticketed event takes place on the 18th, but supplementary workshops, excursions and activities build around the conference.

## Jai Thep Festival (January/February)

Taking place on the final weekend on January, Jai Thep Music and Arts festival is northern Thailand's premiere multi-day festival. Featuring acts from Thailand and around the globe, you can discover new artists, dance your tush off with great DJs, explore yoga, acrobatics, flow and other performing arts, or expand your artistic and spiritual horizons in the many workshops.

Jai Thep manages to pack the creativity and cooperation of massive events like Burning Man into an intimate gathering where you'll meet a couple hundred of your new best friends. With options for camping or day-passes, you can dip in and out of the experience or throw yourself headlong into the three-day fray.

While not specifically a nomad event, just about anybody in the Chiang Mai are who likes fun and art will be found at this outdoor festival.
