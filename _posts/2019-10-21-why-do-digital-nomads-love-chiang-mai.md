Thailand's second city and its undisputed cultural capital. Take a gander at the endless temples and scenic mountains and it's no wonder why Chiang Mai draws millions of visitors a year. Once you taste your first kao soi or sai-ua sausage, you'll also start to understand why many never leave.

But why is it that digital nomads are so obsessed with Chiang Mai? While its ranking wobbles up and down seasonally, you'll almost always [find Chiang Mai topping the charts on the like of Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/best-cities-for-digital-nomads){: target="_blank"}, and anyone who's been "nomadding" it up for a while is sure to have the city on their radar.

There are scores of blog posts and videos on the topic, so to make this worth publishing, we're gonna help add some context. We've got your classic checklist for essntial reading, but we'll also give you the why of it.

Any nincompoop can show up and get a good sense of the why for themselves (or hire someone on Upwork to research and regurgitate their own version of course), but with our history here, we hope to add a little more nuance. How did these things come about, how have they changed over time, and how unique are these factors really?

So without further ado, here are the ten reasons why Chiang Mai is such a beloved digital nomad hotspot.

## 1\. Well-Developed Travel Insfrastructure

Let's start with a big round of applause for dear old CNX. For those not in the know, that's the airport code for Chiang Mai International Airport, the gateway to the city.

It's a given that good airport connections are important to the location independent entrepreneur with a penchant for country-hopping, so the ability to come and go easily is one of the top reasons for Chiang Mai's popularity.

It might seem like a small thing, but heading out to the airport from other Thai cities like takes time. Bangkok? Good luck getting in or out during rush hour which last basically half the day. Phuket? Pattaya? That's a looooong drive my friend. Anywhere in the islands? You've got ferries to contend with if not also extra connecting flights.

In Chiang Mai, most of us live within 30 minutes of the airport. 30 minutes is also about the time you typically need to allot to going through security (if you're fond of living on the edge). It's pretty easy breezy all around.

[CNX takes you directly to most anywhere you want to go in Thailand and tons more destinations abroad](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-chiang-mai-cnx){: target="_blank"} courtesy of Air Asia and other budget-friendly airlines.&nbsp; Coming here from North America or Europe? You might be able to get away with just a single layover thanks to long-hauls from the likes of Emirates, Korean Air (codeshared with Delta), EVA Air, and Cathay Pacific.

While you may be maddened by the noise of airplanes constantly flying overhead when you're living here, its the price we pay to be able to so effortlessly hop and bop around Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Essential for a city that caters to the nomad set.

## 2\. The Weather is Great

Thailand is a sunny, tropical destination. Do we really need to explain further? Temperatures range from a sizzling 36&deg;C in the summer ([which we very sensibly cope with by breaking out into a city-wide water fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_&#40;Thailand&#41;){: target="_blank"}) to an adorably nippy 15&deg;C during "winter" nights and mornings.

Seasonal Affective Disorder is real folks, and if you ditched the rat race to pursue health and happiness, the last thing you want to do is live somewhere that predisposes you to depression. Chiang Mai is fortunately the opposite of the gloomy conditions you get used to in Europe or North America . [We get sunshine at least 150 hours a month, but usually it's almost twice that](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,Chiang-Mai,Thailand){: target="_blank"}. That's basically free therapy right there.&nbsp;

Great weather is also great for being in the outdoors, whether that's lounging by the pool on hot days or searching for waterfalls hidden in the jungle on a crisp morning trek.

That said, we Thais believe in airconditioning, so you're always able to escape mother nature at will and choose your own temperatures. Your coworking and accommodations will almost certainly come with aircon.

High season for tourism corresponds closely with the time of year when digital nomads are in Chiang Mai, from November through February. It's the best time to be here. Sunny warm days and refreshingly cool evenings and nights when you might even - gasp\! - want a sweater.

## 3\. We're Surrounded By Natural Beauty

As mentioned above, Chiang Mai's great weather lends itself to fun in the outdoors, and you absolutely must get out into the scenic countryside and hills of the province.

Just as it's easy to board a flight and go anywhere from Chiang Mai, it's also incredibly easy to escape the city for a change of scenery. Hop on a motorbike or book a redtruck and drive in any-direction - within 30 minutes or less you'll find yourself zipping past rice-fields or winding along mountain roads.

We have a very robust cafe culture in Thailand, and if there's a view point or something pretty we'll stick a cafe next to it. Quite probably there'll be free WiFi as well, so all these escapes into the countryside need not come at the expense of your work or clients.

If you truly do want to escape though, there are jungle homestays, remote retreats, and temble-based Vippassanas in abundance so it's very easy to unplug in order to commune with nature and the spirits and what-have-you.

Few travellers come all the way to Thailand without taking advantage of its natural delights, but it has been our experience that an astonishing number of digital nomads miss out on this aspect entirely, spending all their time within the few blocks that surround their apartment and coworking space.

Those that fall in love with Chiang Mai often cite nature, the mountains and our beautiful surroundings as one of the city's most enchanting qualities, so we highly recommend making the time to truly experience it.

## 4\. People Are Friendly

Truly connecting with Thailand also means connecting with its people. Known as the Land of Smiles, this moniker is one visitors can easily confirm. Hospitality and manners are deeply important to Thais and the country has long been developed for tourism, so everywhere you go you can find friendly people ready to help you.

Beyond the gracious hospitality, Thais have a very live and let live attitude that makes it easy for people from very different backgrounds to feel like they have a place here. While the behavior of Westerners may often elicit a raised eyebrow, it will be accompanied by the Thai smile.

For the oddballs, geeks, and outsiders who never feel like they fit in at home, Chiang Mai is a haven, and the city boasts a very eclectic and intellectual expat community. For anybody who's just bursting with creative expression or just likes to be a little outrageous, welcome, you will find your weirdos here.&nbsp;

Thai people are very friendly, but it's also the long-standing expat community that makes Chiang Mai such a great place for digital nomads. The city has long been home to English Teachers, NGO workers, and a thriving int'l business community. The first wave of the digital nomads movement were the tech workers who relocated to Chiang Mai which has long been a destination for software outsourcing.

Get to know the locals, we're a weird, wonderful bunch and you might be surprised at the tech, innovation, and entrepreneurship that's happening outside the nomad scene.

## 5\. Making Friends is Easy

## 6\. You're Surrounded By Talent

.

## 7\. There's Support for Personal Development

If you've been at this entrepreneurship game for any amount of time, you've probably started to realize that success isn't just about hard work and the perfect funnel, it has a lot more to do with personal and interpersonal skills.&nbsp;

Creating something out of nothing takes grit, perserverance, and a constant ability to problem-solve. The website and the ads are the easy part hon. What prevents most businesses from scaling and breaks apart founding teams? Poor communication and a lack of self-awareness.

Fortunately, Chiang Mai's an incredible place to do the self work that can prime you for, not just professional success, but greater satisfaction in life. Whether your brand of woo woo leans more towards crystals or NLP, you'll find experts, coaches, and support groups galore in Chiang Mai.

Thailand's long been a destination for spirituality and wellness and something of this manages to seep into the day to day of life here, no matter which crowd you run with. People here talk about setting boundaries, self-care, meditation and emotional intelligence in the same breath they lay out their plans for taking over the world (or highly lucrative niche)&nbsp;

Eat healthy, wholesome food, go vegan or Paleo. Try yoga, Crossfit or pole dance. Go to a bio-hacking meetup, embark on a silent meditation retreat, or delve into Thai massage. When it comes to nurturing the mind, body, and spirit, Chiang Mai's got you covered.

## 8\. The Food is Goddamn Delicious

## 9\. A Great Lifestyle is Affordable

It's not that Chiang Mai is the absolute cheapest place to live, but ther eare so many options at every pricepoint offering tremendous value for money.

## 10\. It's Easy to Get Around

Try living in Bangkok where it takes half an hour to get anywhere and you can easily lose a third of your day just to travel. if you work form home, thsi is fine of course, but then what kind of life is that?

## 11\. Easy Visa Options

Ok, ok, hold your horses\! We can practically hear you long-timers screaming your dissent from across the web. If you've been here a while, you know that it has, in actuality, become harder to spend long stretches of time in Thailand as the immigration department has tightened up visa controls and, ya know, actually enforced rules and such.

What's also true though, is that a significant number of passports, especially those from Europe and North America, are able to enter Thailand visa-free. It's quite common for people to arrive, get stamped in, and then simply apply for an extension to add another 30 days to the first 30 you're given, all without ever having to make an embassy appointment or pay a fee. Apply for a tourist visa ahead of time and you can start with 60 days.

If you're coming for the first time or you're a classic digital nomad who's constantly on the go, this is great. For those of you who are more into slow-travel or working to make Chiang Mai your hub, however, Thailand's current visa situation does leave a lot to be desired.

For a loooooong time, it was easy to swan into the country and when your stay was up, just border hop to Mae Sai, Vientiane, Penang, Bali, Hanoi or any number of nearby spots and then mosey back in for a fresh stamp. Alas, these golden years are over. This easy movement is absolutely one of the factors that helped make Chiang Mai a hub for digital nomads, but a little more effort is required these days.

We'll save the details on the many options for extending your stay in Thailand long-term for its own post (Education Visas, the Elite Visa, hacking multiple passports etc.), but the gist is, plan ahead, or plan to keep moving.

Efforts on both the local and national level are in place to push for more nomad-friendly visa options (and you can help these move forward by [contributing to a survey on the Economic Impact of Digital Nomads in Chiang Mai](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceB-ZX_nBstr5P6XExdxofVpxadse-MKrmtuyN6xq2qg5xnw/viewform?usp=sf_link){: target="_blank"}) so while we wait on the government to get immigration in line with national policies for attracting talent, you've got options and [we've got your back when it comes to visa services](https://www.facebook.com/mjandco.th/){: target="_blank"}.

## 12\. Blazing-fast WiFi

Lastly, of course, no list of why Chiang Mai caters so well to digital nomads would be complete without acknowledging the importance of great motherf\*\*\*ing WiFi. It's not optional, and [Chiang Mai's internet speeds](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/thailand){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;and coverage are solid.

In other nomad hotspots like Bali, coworking spaces offer the antidote to insfrastructure issues like power cuts and sh\*\*ty WiFi, but in Chiang Mai, you never have to worry. Thailand has an excellent telecom infrastructure and wherever you may wander, you won't be far from WiFi.

It's available for free at nearly all accommodations, cafes, restaurants, massage shops, nail salons and more. Cheap data-plans and extensive 4G coverage mean that your phone is always connected and can act as a WiFi hotspot too.

At coworking spaces you'll typically have access to multiple networks for backup and those who prefer to work from their home office will have no trouble setting up private internet without the need for a long-term contract.

Whether you prefer the phrase "digital nomad" or "location independent" the crux is that you rely on your laptop and WiFi to enable your lifestyle. Chiang Mai has excellent internet, making it an ideal place from which to live and work.

Phew\! You made it. It's a long list, we know.

As locals and natives, perhaps we're a little biased here at CoCo as to all the reasons our city is so great, but it doesn't seem hard to understand why digital nomads have chosen and continue to choose Chiang Mai. It's got everything you need to live, work, play, and lead your best life. And afterall, that's what embarking upon this digital nomad path is all about isn't it? Having the freedom and the flexibility to design your dream life.&nbsp;

If you're a newbie nomad, you could do far worse than choose Chiang Mai as base from which to build your business and begin your travels. Those who've been around the block (or rather the globe…) a couple times will continue to find tremendous value in the city, whether it be from its amenities or it's talented community.

At CoCo, we're obsessed with our hometown and we want you to love it as much as we do. That's why we've designed services, programs, and partnerships specifically to tap you into the best the city has to offer. Our dream is that digital nomads can continue to connect here, bringing their talent, their ideas and their creativity to&nbsp;
